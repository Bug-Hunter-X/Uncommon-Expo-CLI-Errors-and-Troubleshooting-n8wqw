# Uncommon Expo CLI Errors and Troubleshooting

This repository demonstrates some uncommon errors encountered when using the Expo CLI and provides solutions for resolving them.  The errors can range from cryptic build failures to unexpected behavior during development or deployment. 

## Common Scenarios

* **Android Build Errors:**  Android builds can be particularly problematic due to the complexity of the Android SDK and build system. 
* **Dependency Conflicts:**  Conflicts between various packages in your project (especially those using native modules) can lead to unexpected errors.
* **Configuration Issues:** Incorrect configurations in your `app.json`, `package.json`, or `babel.config.js` files are common sources of problems. 
* **Expo CLI Version Conflicts:** Having outdated or incompatible versions of the Expo CLI can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

## Solutions

Solutions often involve careful review of the error message, troubleshooting steps such as cleaning the build cache, checking dependencies, or updating the Expo CLI to the latest version.
