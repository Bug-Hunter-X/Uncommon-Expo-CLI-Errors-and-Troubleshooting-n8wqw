Solutions for resolving Expo CLI errors are highly context-dependent. Here are some general strategies:

1. **Examine the Error Message Carefully:** Expo CLI error messages often contain clues about the underlying cause. Carefully review the entire message and focus on keywords or specific file paths mentioned. 
2. **Clean and Rebuild:** Use the `expo prebuild` and `expo start --clean` commands to clean the build cache and attempt a fresh build. 
3. **Check Dependencies:** Ensure that all dependencies listed in your `package.json` are compatible with your project and the Expo SDK version you're using. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` after making changes to dependencies. 
4. **Update the Expo CLI:** Ensure you have the latest version of the Expo CLI. Update it using `npm install -g expo-cli` or the equivalent yarn command. 
5. **Verify Configuration Files:** Check your `app.json`, `package.json`, and `babel.config.js` for any typos, inconsistencies, or incorrect configurations. 
6. **Check Android Environment:** If the errors are related to the Android build system, ensure that you have the correct Android SDK version, build tools, and other necessary components installed and configured. 
7. **Search for Similar Issues:** Search online for error messages to see if others have encountered similar issues and their solutions.  Check the Expo forums and GitHub issues.

// This is not a direct fix for Expo CLI errors, but an example of error handling in your app's code

fetch('some-api-endpoint')
  .then(response => {
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
    }
    return response.json();
  })
  .then(data => {
    // Process the successful API response
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // Handle any network or API errors
    console.error('There has been a problem with your fetch operation:', error);
  });
